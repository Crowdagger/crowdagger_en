Two dykes enter a bar, and all eyes turn to them.

The first one is tall and undeniably fat. She has pink long hair. Two
fake cat's ears lie above her head. She is wearing a long black dress
with a lot of patches that make it abundantly clear that she is not
heterosexual. Her name is Amelia. 

The second one is a bit shorter and thinner. They are wearing a purple
jacket matching their purple pants above a yellow dress shirt. Their
black hair is short, and trimmed on one size. Their name, or rather
their number, is 9. 

They are what could be called
of middle-eastern ascent, though the patrons of this bar would probably
use a much more derogatory term. The same patrons would also surely
not refer to them by "them" and would rather use "it", but, even
though an external narrator must sometimes dwell inside the darkest of
human minds, there is a limit to the villainy that this one is willing
to share.

The bar is called the "the Stronghold". It is an associative place,
located in the centre of Lille, France. Self-described as a place
promoting the french and flemish culture, it would be more appropriate
to describe it as the gathering place of all the boneheads who like to
raise their right hand, though a respected elected member of a
far-right party might also occasionally come in to get a drink.

This place, needless to say, is not very "LGBT-friendly". This
explains why all eyes turned to our lesbian protagonists when they entered. This also
explains why a tall, muscular head-shaved man wearing a tight *Fred
Perry* shirt who was presently sitting at the bar has now gotten on his feet
and is advancing towards the two dykes in a threatening way. 

Amelia can't help giggling. For homophobic dudes, some sure don't lack
some homoerotism. If he wasn't a nazi, the guy could clearly have been
a cover boy for *Têtu*, France's leading gay magazine.

"What are you doing here?", the cover boy bonehead says. "This is a
private place."

"Don't worry about us", 9 says, raising the palm of their hands in a
futile attempt to appease their audience. "We didn't come here to start a fight."

"Yeah", Amelia says. "Don't worry about the two guys that were
outside. They are fine."

"’Depends on your definition of 'fine'", 9 says.

"I mean, they'll live."

"Probably. Anyway, we just came here to deliver a message."

"We don't want your fucking message, bitches!", the bonehead shouts,
heterosexually. "Get outta here or *I*'ll get you out."

"The message isn't for you", 9 says. "Amy?"

"Yeah?"

"Deliver it, will you?"

As the bonhead is getting closer to them, Amelia moves forward too. The
man throws his hands forward to push or punch her, but the
pink-haired catgirl has already grabbed his arms and gives him a
headbutt. The skull of the bonehead is thick enough to absorb the
blow, but he visibly remains puzzled for a quarter of a
second. Enough time for Amelia to put one of her hands between the
man's legs, and the other on his left shoulder.

Then, she starts lifting him, and he becomes *more* puzzled. Most
people, when they see a tall, fat woman, tend only to judge her
appearance based on sexist criteria and assume that she is lazy, eats
too much, and has no physical activity besides getting from her bed to
her couch. They rarely see their dangerous wrestling potential which,
in the case of Amelia, is not so shabby. 

Then, she throws the bonehead on his fascist comrades, just as if she 
was bowling. 

"Well, I guess the message is delivered", 9 says. 

While they were speaking, a fair amount of cleanly head-shaved guys
have stood up with impressive coordination (except for the two who
have been hit by their flying friend and are currently lying on the
ground below his muscle mass).

Amelia joins her hands and crackles her joints, while 9 lets go of a
jaded yawn.

"Well", they say, "'looks like we'll have to make it a *long* message."
